11-AllStarLink is a presentation by AA6BD of CARC in February, 2024 on how to use and build an AllStar node.

This session explores how to install and run AllStar on a Raspberry Pi so you can have a hotspot to communicate with the AllStarLink network, connection to other nodes like W4AM on Lookout Mountain, or W4EDP.

“AllStarLink (ASL) is a world wide network of Amateur Radio repeaters, remote base stations, and hot spots accessible to each other via the Internet and/or private IP networks. AllStar software runs on a dedicated Linux computer (including the Raspberry Pi) that you host at your home, radio site, clubhouse, school, university, workplace, or computer center. AllStar is based on the open source Asterisk PBX and is released under the GNU GPL and is free for anyone to use. The core of AllStar and AllStarLink is the powerful app_rpt application and associated modules that load into the Asterisk PBX system.”

CARC recently installed an AllStar node 602640 at its Lookout Mountain 144.390 MHz repeater.  You can use it to connect with any other AllStar Node.  You can also connect to it using your own AllStar node, as we will discover during this workshop session.
